    """Evaluate cards in Omaha game.

    In the Omaha rule, players can make hand with 3 cards from the 5 community cards and
    2 cards from their own 4 hole cards, then totally 5 cards.
    This function selects the best combination and return its rank.

    Args:
        cards(int | str | Card]): List of cards
            The first five parameters are the community cards.
            The later four parameters are the player hole cards.

    Raises:
        ValueError: Unsupported size of the cards

    Returns:
        int: The rank of the given cards with the best five cards.

    Examples:
        >>> rank1 = evaluate_omaha_cards(
                "3c", "9c", "3h", "9h", "6h", # ["9c", "9h", "6h"]
                "Ac", "Kc", "Qc", "Jc"        # ["Ac", "Kc"]
            )

        >>> rank2 = evaluate_omaha_cards(
                "3c", "9c", "3h", "9h", "6h", # ["9c", "9h", "6h"]
                "Ad", "Kd", "Qd", "Jd"        # ["Ad", "Kd"]
