## Usage

Each chapter includes:
- A markdown file with theoretical explanations and examples
- A Python implementation file with code for the toy games and calculations

To run a specific chapter's implementation:
```bash
python ch10_game_theory.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- SciPy (for optimization algorithms)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```
